<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Disconnect Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fused Rotary Disconnect Switches</li><li>Non-Fused Rotary Disconnect Switches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary Disconnect Switches are used in electrical systems to isolate equipment for maintenance or repair. There are two types of Rotary Disconnect Switches: Fused and Non-Fused. Fused Rotary Disconnect Switches allow for added safety as they contain a fuse, which protects against overload or short circuit conditions. Non-Fused Rotary Disconnect Switches, on the other hand, do not have a fuse and are typically used when overcurrent protection is already provided elsewhere in the system. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the safe operation of electrical equipment.</p></p>
