<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric VTOL (eVTOL) Aircraft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>All Electric</li><li>Hybrid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft market involves two main types: all-electric and hybrid. All-electric eVTOLs rely solely on electric power for both vertical take-off and cruising flight. They do not require any combustion-based systems and are emission-free. On the other hand, hybrid eVTOLs utilize a combination of electric and combustion engines, enabling longer flights and increased range. These hybrids can switch between electric mode for vertical take-off and landing and combustion mode for sustained cruising, offering a balance between power and endurance.</p></p>
