<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air-cushion Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Skirted Air-cushion Vehicles</li><li>Sidewall Air-cushion Vehicles</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Air-cushion vehicles, also known as hovercrafts, can be classified into two market types: skirted air-cushion vehicles and sidewall air-cushion vehicles. Skirted air-cushion vehicles employ a flexible skirt around the lower part of the craft, creating an air cushion that lifts the vehicle off the ground. This design enables the craft to travel over various surfaces, including land, water, ice, or vegetation. On the other hand, sidewall air-cushion vehicles have rigid sidewalls that contain the air cushion, allowing them to navigate smoothly on water surfaces while maintaining stability. Both types offer versatility and unique capabilities for different applications.</p></p>
