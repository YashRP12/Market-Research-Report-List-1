<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Ventilator Market can be categorized into two types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators require intubation, a process of inserting a tube into the baby's windpipe, to deliver oxygen and support breathing. Non-invasive ventilators avoid intubation by providing oxygen through a mask or nasal prongs. Both types serve the same purpose of assisting infants with respiratory issues, but non-invasive ventilators offer a less intrusive method. The choice between the two depends on the severity and specific needs of the newborn.</p></p>
