<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IDA Process</li><li>Glycine Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, commonly known as glyphosate, is produced using two different processes: IDA Process and Glycine Process. The IDA Process involves the reaction of glycine with formaldehyde and phosphorus trichloride, while the Glycine Process uses a different pathway using glycine, paraformaldehyde, and phosphorus trichloride. These two processes result in the production of glyphosate, which is widely used as an herbicide. The market for N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine is therefore divided into IDA Process and Glycine Process markets based on the production method utilized.</p></p>
