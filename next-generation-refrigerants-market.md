<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Next Generation Refrigerants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Refrigerants</li><li>Hydrofluoroolefins</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The next generation refrigerants market includes two types: natural refrigerants and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). Natural refrigerants are substances found in nature, such as ammonia, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons, that have low global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). They are environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional refrigerants. On the other hand, HFOs are synthetic refrigerants made by combining hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with olefins. HFOs have low GWP and are being increasingly used as replacements for HFCs, which have high GWP and contribute to global warming.</p></p>
