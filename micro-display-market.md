<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micro-Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Displays</li><li>Transmissive Displays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The micro-display market consists of two main types: reflective displays and transmissive displays. Reflective displays utilize ambient light to create an image, making them suitable for outdoor use and efficient in terms of power consumption. On the other hand, transmissive displays require a backlight to create an image, making them more vibrant and suitable for indoor use. While reflective displays offer better visibility in bright environments, transmissive displays provide better color reproduction and contrast. Both types have their own benefits and are used in various applications based on specific requirements.</p></p>
