<p><strong>The Sub acute Care Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Sub-acute Care Ventilators</li><li>Noninvasive Sub-acute Care Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Sub-acute care ventilators are medical devices used to assist patients with breathing difficulties. There are two types: invasive and noninvasive. Invasive sub-acute care ventilators require inserting a tube into the patient's airway, delivering oxygen directly into the lungs. Noninvasive sub-acute care ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory support without the need for intubation, typically using a mask. Both types are designed to improve the patient's respiratory function and are commonly used in sub-acute healthcare settings to aid in recovery and provide temporary respiratory assistance.</p></p>
