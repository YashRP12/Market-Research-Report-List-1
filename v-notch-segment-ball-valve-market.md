<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The V-Notch Segment Ball Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flanged</li><li>Flangeless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The V-Notch Segment Ball Valve market consists of two primary types: Flanged and Flangeless. Flanged valves are equipped with a flange at the end of the valve body, allowing for easy installation and connection to other pipeline components. These valves are widely used in industries where a secure and leak-free connection is crucial. Flangeless valves, on the other hand, do not have a flange and are typically weldable directly into pipelines. They are preferred in applications where space limitations or environmental considerations make flange installation impractical or unnecessary.</p></p>
