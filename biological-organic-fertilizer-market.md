<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biological Organic Fertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic Residue Fertilizers</li><li>Microorganism (Biofertilizers)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biological organic fertilizers can be classified into two main types: organic residue fertilizers and microorganism (biofertilizers) market. Organic residue fertilizers are derived from the decomposition of organic materials such as crop residues, animal manure, and kitchen waste. These fertilizers provide nutrients to plants in a slow-release manner, improving soil fertility and promoting sustainable agriculture practices. On the other hand, microorganism-based fertilizers, also known as biofertilizers, consist of living organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae. These beneficial microorganisms enhance nutrient availability in the soil, aid in nutrient uptake by plants, and improve soil structure and overall plant health.</p></p>
