<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifunctional High Frequency Knifes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Circuit</li><li>Bipolar Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Multifunctional High Frequency Knives market is classified into two types: Monopolar Circuit and Bipolar Circuit. In the Monopolar Circuit, the electrical current flows from the electrode through the body and returns back to the generator through a large pad placed on the patient's skin. This type is mainly used for cutting, coagulating, and dissecting tissues with high precision. On the other hand, in the Bipolar Circuit, the electrical current passes between two tips of the instrument, reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissues. It is primarily employed for delicate procedures that require pinpoint accuracy.</p></p>
