<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carotid Embolic Protection Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Total Artery Coverage</li><li>Non-total Artery Coverage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carotid embolic protection devices are designed to capture and remove debris that may dislodge during carotid artery interventions, reducing the risk of stroke. Total artery coverage devices provide complete filtration along the entire length of the treated artery, ensuring maximum protection. On the other hand, non-total artery coverage devices only cover a portion of the artery. While both types aim to prevent debris from reaching the brain, total artery coverage offers more comprehensive protection by filtering potential emboli throughout the entire procedure.</p></p>
