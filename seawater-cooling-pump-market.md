<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seawater Cooling Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The seawater cooling pump market consists of two main types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps are designed to increase the fluid's kinetic energy by using an impeller to create centrifugal force. They are commonly used for higher flow rates and lower pressure applications. On the other hand, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a specific volume of fluid and then forcing it through the pump. They are better suited for lower flow rates and higher pressure situations.</p></p>
