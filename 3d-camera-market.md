<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Target Free Camera</li><li>Target Camera</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The 3D camera market can be divided into two types: target-free camera and target camera. A target-free camera is a type of 3D camera that can capture three-dimensional images without the need for any specific target or marker. It uses advanced technologies like laser, time-of-flight, or structured light to create depth perception. On the other hand, a target camera requires a specific target or marker to be placed in the scene for accurate depth mapping. These cameras often use techniques like stereo vision to capture and measure the distance between the target and the camera, enabling precise 3D image reconstruction.</p></p>
