<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Continuous Variable Transmission Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Belt Connection</li><li>Chain Connection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automatic Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT) market offers two types of connections: belt and chain. Belt connection CVTs use a flexible belt that connects the engine and the transmission. This type of CVT provides smooth gear ratio adjustments but may face issues with slippage. On the other hand, chain connection CVTs utilize a chain to transmit power between the engine and transmission. They are more durable and better suited for high-torque applications but may produce more noise and vibration compared to belt CVTs.</p></p>
