<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Pump</li><li>Patch Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) devices, also known as insulin pumps, are revolutionary medical devices used by individuals with diabetes to manage their blood glucose levels effectively. There are two primary market types of these devices: normal pump and patch pump. Normal pumps comprise a pump connected to an infusion set by a tube, allowing the user to deliver insulin continuously. Conversely, patch pumps consist of an all-in-one device adhered directly to the skin, providing insulin delivery without the need for tubing. Both types assist individuals in maintaining tight control over their blood sugar levels and offer flexibility and convenience in diabetes management.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Devices Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I Diabetes</li><li>Type II Diabetes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion devices are used for the management of both Type I and Type II diabetes. Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body does not produce insulin. These devices provide a consistent supply of insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Type II diabetes occurs when the body develops resistance to insulin. The devices help in administering insulin directly into the subcutaneous tissue, enabling better glycemic control. They are effective tools for maintaining insulin levels and managing diabetes in both Type I and Type II patients.</p></p>
