<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MRI Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open MRI systems</li><li>Closed MRI systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>MRI systems are medical imaging devices used to create detailed images of the internal structures of the human body. There are two main types of MRI systems: open MRI systems and closed MRI systems. Open MRI systems have a more spacious design with wider openings, making them suitable for patients with claustrophobia or larger body sizes. Closed MRI systems have a tunnel-like design and produce higher quality images, but some patients may experience discomfort or anxiety due to the confined space. Both types have their own unique advantages and are used in various medical settings.</p></p>
