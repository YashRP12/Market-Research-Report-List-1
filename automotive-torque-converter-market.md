<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Torque Converter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Stage Torque Converter</li><li>Multistage Torque Converter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive torque converter market consists of two major types: single-stage torque converters and multistage torque converters. A single-stage torque converter is a type of fluid coupling that transfers torque from the engine to the transmission through a single set of turbines and stators. On the other hand, a multistage torque converter has multiple sets of turbines and stators, which allows for more efficient power transfer and better acceleration. Both types play a crucial role in transmitting power and enhancing the overall performance of automobiles.</p></p>
