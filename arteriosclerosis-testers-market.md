<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arteriosclerosis Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PWV</li><li>CF-PWV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arteriosclerosis testers are used in medical settings to evaluate the stiffness and health of arteries. Two common types of tests are Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) and Central-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (CF-PWV). PWV measures the speed at which blood pressure waves travel through arteries, providing information about arterial stiffness. CF-PWV specifically measures the velocity of the pulse waves between the aorta and the femoral artery. These tests help diagnose arteriosclerosis, a condition characterized by the hardening and narrowing of arteries, assisting in the management and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.</p></p>
