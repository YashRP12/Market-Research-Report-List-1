<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Treatment Coagulant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic Coagulant</li><li>Organic Coagulant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water treatment coagulant market consists of two major types: inorganic coagulants and organic coagulants. Inorganic coagulants are typically metallic salts, such as aluminum sulfate or iron chloride, which work by destabilizing and clumping together suspended particles in water. Organic coagulants, on the other hand, are derived from natural substances or synthetically produced polymers. They function by neutralizing the electrical charges on suspended particles, allowing them to bind together and settle. Both types of coagulants play a crucial role in the water treatment process by facilitating the removal of impurities and suspended solids.</p></p>
