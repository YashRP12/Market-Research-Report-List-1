<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Olefinic Thermoplastic Elastomer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Polyolefin</li><li>Thermoplastic Vulcanizates</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Olefinic thermoplastic elastomers refer to a type of materials that possess both the characteristics of elastomers (rubbery texture) and thermoplastics (ability to be melted and reshaped multiple times). There are two main types: thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) and thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPV). TPO is a blend of polypropylene and ethylene propylene rubber, offering good mechanical properties and resistance to heat and chemicals. TPV, on the other hand, involves cross-linking olefinic plastomers with a vulcanized rubber phase, providing enhanced flexibility, elasticity, and higher heat resistance.</p></p>
