<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helicopter Flight Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primary Flight Control System</li><li>Secondary Flight Control System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Helicopter flight control systems consist of two main types: Primary Flight Control System (PFCS) and Secondary Flight Control System (SFCS). PFCS is primarily responsible for regulating the helicopter's attitude and controlling its movement in three axes (roll, pitch, and yaw). It includes components like cyclic and collective controls, as well as the main rotor system. On the other hand, SFCS supports the PFCS and includes systems like trim controls, autopilot, and stability augmentation. SFCS enhances the overall control and stability of the helicopter during operations.</p></p>
