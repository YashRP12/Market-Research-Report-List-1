<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Multiple Units (EMU) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Centralized</li><li>Power Decentralized</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric Multiple Units (EMU) are a type of train consisting of multiple self-propelled carriages. In a power centralized market, the EMUs receive power from a central source such as overhead electrical lines, ensuring a uniform distribution of power throughout the train. On the other hand, in a power decentralized market, each carriage of the EMU has its own power source, allowing for increased flexibility in operation and reducing dependence on a central power supply. Both market types have their own advantages and are used based on the specific requirements and infrastructure of the railway network.</p></p>
