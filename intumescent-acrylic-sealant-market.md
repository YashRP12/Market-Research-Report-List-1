<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intumescent Acrylic Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based</li><li>Solvent-Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The intumescent acrylic sealant market is divided into two types: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based sealants are formulated using water as a carrier instead of solvents, making them more environmentally friendly and easy to clean up. They are commonly used in applications where low VOC emissions are required. Solvent-based sealants, on the other hand, are formulated with organic solvents that evaporate during curing. These sealants offer quicker curing times and better adhesion to various surfaces, making them suitable for high-performance applications.</p></p>
