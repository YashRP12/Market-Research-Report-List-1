<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Cooling Fan (above 200mm) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The large cooling fan market consists of two main types: centrifugal fans and axial fans. Centrifugal fans use a rotating impeller to generate airflow perpendicular to the fan's axis, making them ideal for applications with high resistance to airflow. Axial fans, on the other hand, generate airflow parallel to the fan's axis and are suitable for low-resistance applications. Both types are commonly used for cooling purposes in various industries, including HVAC systems, data centers, and industrial processes.</p></p>
