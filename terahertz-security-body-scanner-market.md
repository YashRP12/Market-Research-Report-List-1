<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Terahertz Security Body Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Terahertz security body scanners are classified into two main types: active type and passive type. Active type scanners emit terahertz waves towards the subject and measure the reflections, allowing for the detection of concealed objects on the body. These scanners provide real-time imaging and are effective for security purposes. On the other hand, passive type scanners detect the naturally emitted terahertz waves from the human body. They analyze the unique signature of these waves to identify concealed objects without emitting any additional radiation. Passive scanners are considered less invasive and more suitable for privacy concerns.</p></p>
