<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Brake Systems and Subsystems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The vehicle brake systems and subsystems market consists of two primary types: drum brake and disc brake. Drum brakes use brake shoes that press against a drum to create friction, thereby stopping the vehicle. They are less expensive and commonly found in the rear wheels. Disc brakes, on the other hand, utilize brake pads that grip onto a disc, creating friction to halt the vehicle. Disc brakes are more efficient, provide better heat dissipation, and are often used in the front wheels for enhanced braking performance.</p></p>
