<p><strong>The Portable/Transportable Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portable/transportable neonatal ventilators are medical devices used in the treatment of infants with breathing difficulties. There are two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators are used when an infant's airway needs to be supported with a breathing tube inserted into the trachea. On the other hand, non-invasive ventilators deliver breathing support through nasal prongs or masks, without the need for intubation. These devices offer flexibility and mobility, allowing them to be easily transported and used in various healthcare settings.</p></p>
