<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Protection Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adhesive Free</li><li>Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Surface protection films can be categorized into two types: adhesive free films and adhesive films. Adhesive free films are designed without any adhesive coating on the film. They rely on other methods such as static cling or suction to adhere to surfaces, ensuring easy and residue-free removal. On the other hand, adhesive films have a layer of adhesive coating on the film, allowing for strong and long-lasting adhesion to various surfaces. This adhesive layer ensures the film stays in place and provides protection against scratches, abrasion, and other damages.</p></p>
