<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transmission Coolers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fan Cooling Type</li><li>Water Cooling Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Transmission coolers are devices used in vehicles to prevent the transmission from overheating. There are two types available in the market - fan cooling type and water cooling type. The fan cooling type uses fans to blow air over the transmission cooler, dissipating heat and maintaining optimal temperature. On the other hand, the water cooling type utilizes water or coolant to carry away heat from the transmission. Both types ensure effective cooling and prevent damage to the transmission system, albeit using different mechanisms.</p></p>
