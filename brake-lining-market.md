<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brake Lining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Asbestos Type</li><li>Semimetal Type</li><li>NAO Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The brake lining market comprises three main types: asbestos type, semimetal type, and NAO (non-asbestos organic) type. Asbestos brake linings were widely used in the past due to their heat resistance and durability, but have been banned in many countries due to health concerns. Semimetal brake linings are a blend of materials like metals and non-metals, offering good wear resistance and thermal stability. NAO brake linings are made from organic materials like kevlar or glass fibers mixed with friction modifiers, providing excellent stopping power, noise reduction, and low dust production.</p></p>
