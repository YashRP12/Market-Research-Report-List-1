<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Model Animal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Homozygote</li><li>Heterozygote</li><li>Genetically Modified</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The laboratory model animal market can be classified into three types: homozygote, heterozygote, and genetically modified. Homozygote refers to animals that have two identical copies of a particular gene, which allows for consistent and predictable experimental results. Heterozygote animals have two different copies of the gene, resulting in variable outcomes. Genetically modified animals are those that have been altered through genetic engineering techniques, allowing scientists to study specific genes and their effects on various diseases and conditions. These different types of animals provide researchers with diverse options for conducting experiments.</p></p>
