<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Forestry Equipment Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic</li><li>Solid</li><li>Polyurethane</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The forestry equipment tire market can be categorized into three types: pneumatic, solid, and polyurethane. Pneumatic tires are made of rubber and filled with compressed air, providing good shock absorption and traction on uneven terrain. Solid tires are made of solid rubber, eliminating the risk of punctures, but providing less comfort and grip. Polyurethane tires are lightweight and durable, offering good resistance to abrasion and tear. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, and their selection depends on the specific needs and conditions of forestry equipment operations.</p></p>
