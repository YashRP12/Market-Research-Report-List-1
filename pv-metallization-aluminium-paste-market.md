<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Metallization Aluminium Paste Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BSF Solar Cells</li><li>PERC Solar Cells</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The PV metallization aluminum paste market is divided into two types: BSF solar cells and PERC solar cells. BSF solar cells are traditional solar cells that use a back surface field (BSF) to enhance efficiency. These cells have a simple structure and are widely used in the solar industry. PERC (Passivated Emitter Rear Cell) solar cells, on the other hand, have a more advanced design with a passivated rear surface. This allows for improved efficiency and higher power output compared to BSF solar cells. Both types of solar cells require PV metallization aluminum paste for their manufacturing processes.</p></p>
