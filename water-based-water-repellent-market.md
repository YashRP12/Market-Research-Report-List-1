<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Based Water Repellent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Combining Type</li><li>Non-combining Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water-based water repellents are used to protect surfaces from water damage. There are two main types of these repellents: combining type and non-combining type. Combining type water repellents completely combine with the substrate, creating a strong bond that maintains the repellent properties. On the other hand, non-combining type water repellents form a thin layer on the surface without fully incorporating into the material. Both types provide water resistance, but the combining type offers enhanced durability and longevity due to its full integration with the substrate.</p></p>
