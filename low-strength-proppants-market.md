<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Strength Proppants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Proppant</li><li>Ultra-low Strength Proppant</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Low Strength Proppants are used in hydraulic fracturing to keep the fractures open, allowing the release of oil and gas. Conventional Proppants are high-strength particles, commonly made of sand, that can withstand high pressure. They are efficient but can cause excessive damage to the formation. Ultra-low Strength Proppants are designed to be easily crushed, reducing formation damage but still providing support. This market type offers a balance between conventional proppants and high-cost techniques, enhancing production efficiency while minimizing adverse effects on the oil and gas reservoirs.</p></p>
